# random

_A collection of random/stupid/pointless stuff_

`onion.sh` -- a typical exercise is futility; adds/removes a defined number of gzip/base64 layers from a given input
`obf.sh` -- encryption is so pass√©, but why settle for boring old ROT13, when you can supplement it with some other similarly bad ideas?
