# random

_A collection of random/stupid/useful/useless/pointless stuff (delete as appropriate)_

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `locate_tty.sh` | This one is actually useful; do you have many nested terminals open?  Want to restart your term em but not sure if you were in the middle of something?  Then this is the script for you!  Looks for processes matching given params and sends a BEL to the owning TTY |
| `obf.sh` | Encryption is so pass√©, but why settle for boring old ROT13 obfuscation, when you can supplement it with some other similarly bad ideas? |
| `onion.sh` | A typical exercise is futility; adds/removes a defined number of gzip/base64 layers from a given input. Layers ... onion?  Geddit?! |
| `pwned.sh` | Do you feel lucky, well do ya punk?  Make a query for a given password against the <https://haveibeenpwned.com/> API and see just _how_ bad your day can get! |
| `udecode.sh` | Quick and dirty URL decoder |
